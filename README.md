CS230 Operating Platforms 
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room project was made for Creative Technology Solutions. They taskes my devlopers with creating an application that was accesible over many platforms and have the same look. The app was already available on androids, but they wanted to widen the use. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  The part I did well was accidently not paying attention and doing all three projects in the first week. That gave me plenty of time to revise the project as the semester continued. 
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I found the break down the most easy to follow because it was mainly just questions to answer and the template was provided for me. This has prepared me for any future cleint and developer documents I will need. 
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would most likely like to revise the part about client roadblocks in part one. I feel like there would be am easier way to explain now that I have finished the class and learned how to talk about code easier. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I looked at the user's needs through the document and then outlined on the template what was needed. I looked into what software was the bost accesible across multiple platforms. It was important to note that sometimes making something across several platforms can call for more developmental tools which takes more time and cost more. This had to be related to the client. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I have had about six years of coding so it is something that comes easy to be especially in lower level coding classes. I always break down and create a document of what needs to be done and how everything ties together. I like to write in psuedocode, but a lot more english than most people use. I then write everything I can and check for errors as I go.
